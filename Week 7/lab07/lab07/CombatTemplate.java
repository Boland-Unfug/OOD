/*
 * Input: 2 players 
Output: winning Player 
 
 
Step: 
 
The first Player attacks the second Player (say, P attacks Q).  
After the hit, if the other Player is alive, they attack the first Player (Q attacks P). 
 
This process continues until one of them dies.

Can modify the attack and defense multiplier for each player.
 
Return the winnerâ€™s information.
